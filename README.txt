River + Islands (3D) — Phone-friendly viewer

How to use (easiest):
1) Put this folder anywhere you can host as a static site (recommended):
   - GitHub Pages, Netlify Drop, Cloudflare Pages, or any basic web host.
2) Open index.html in your phone browser (Safari/Chrome).
   - 1 finger: rotate
   - 2 fingers: pan
   - pinch: zoom

Quick local test on a computer:
- If you have Python:
  python -m http.server 8000
  then open http://localhost:8000

Notes:
- This build is "visual-accurate" (fast), optimized for mobile.
- Next upgrade (if you want): add more straight-down images and I can make it more precise.
